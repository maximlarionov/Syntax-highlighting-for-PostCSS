SugarSS syntax highlighting for Sublime Text. This package is a fork of [Syntax-highlighting-for-PostCSS] by @hudochenkov:

* Using SSS syntax highlighting. This covers all of SugarSS syntax, which is covered by Atom version.
* Automatic enable syntax highlighting by `*.sss` file extensions;

There is a lot of possible improvements can be made to this syntax, but frankly, I don't understand in syntax files much and hope for the help of the community.

## Installation

Install with [Package Control].
